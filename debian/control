Description: multiple default gateway support for ifupdown
 This package integrates support for multiple default gateways on
 independent network connections into the Debian ifupdown network
 interface configuration system. It adds new "multi_*" options to the
 /etc/network/interface file format in order to more easily configure
 Linux's policy based routing.
 .
 The policy information used to configure each network interface using
 ifupdown-multi is saved when ifup is run. This allows network
 interfaces using ifupdown-multi to be brought up or down cleanly as
 needed.
